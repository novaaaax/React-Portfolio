                        <p>I live in Philadelphia, PA. Some of my hobbies include video games, cars and everything astronomy. My passion is software development! Currently I'm skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB and Robo 3T. Soon I will be learning React as well. Another language I'm super interested in learing is Python. As stated above, I'm currently studying full stack development at UPENN, but I'm also still searching for opportunities and experience.</p>
